# Overview üåÄ

This repository is the **living documentation on how we are testing the CALYPR system**.

It is currently in the ideating stage, which means we need to...
1. **Determine our strategy** for testing code 
2. **Decide on how** we want to test each component
3. **Document** what we have already been doing for ad-hoc testing


# Quick Start ‚ö°Ô∏è
- add all ad-hoc testing done to `dump.md` (direct commits are fine)
- add general testing strategy to `strategy.md`  (ideally as PR for review)
- post in GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/calypr/test-service/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/calypr/test-service/discussions) for deeper discussion
